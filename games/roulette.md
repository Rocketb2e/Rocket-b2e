# ðŸŽ° Roulette

In the mid-18th century, one of today's most important games emerged; roulette is a classic game that has been played from generation to generation, but has only gained popularity in the last century. In short, roulette is a game with one roulette wheel, 37 equal spaces numbered from 0 to 36. In some versions, the player may encounter symbols instead of numbers, but the premise is the same as in the original game. The roulette rules are simple: To play roulette online, players can place bets on one or more numbers and/or colors, and the bet must be placed before the game's dealer begins the spin. The spin begins as soon as the dealer places the ball on the roulette wheel. The wheel spins, and the player who guesses the number and color where it lands wins the round prize. The prize won is proportional to the amount that was wagered by the player at the start of the round. When the ball stops, the dealer checks the winners, and hands out their respective prizes according to the bet amount.

**Types of Online Roulette:**

* [x] American Roulette - On a base there are 38 numbers in total, with the plus number being a 00.Thus, American roulette has two zeros (0 and 00) where the player can bet.
* [x] European Roulette - In this type of roulette, 37 numbers in total are offered, starting from 1 to 37 and also including 0.
* [x] French Roulette - To play French roulette online, the player must be aware of the difference. In this type one can find the same numbers as we saw in European roulette. However, the difference is that if the ball lands on the number 0, half of the bet is returned to the player.

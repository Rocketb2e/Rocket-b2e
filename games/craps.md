# ðŸŽ² Craps

The game of craps is, thanks to its very simple rules, one of the best known games in land-based casinos around the world!

The most important thing is to apply yourself and learn the basics of dice that can be acquired without too much trouble. Besides, as in almost all games, you also learn by playing. In online craps there are 2 types of players. The shooter, who throws the dice, and the bettor, who bets on the shooter. The bettor can also bet against the shooter and a certain number of outcomes from the dice.

## **Rules**

These are the basic rules of the dice game:

1. If the total result of the two dice is either 07 or 11 the shooter wins the game. This is called a "natural".&#x20;
2. If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 the player loses the game and is called "craps".&#x20;
3. If a 4, 5, 6, 8 or 10 (on the first shot) is obtained, the shooter accumulates the score and is entitled to another throw, which will give him victory if that score is confirmed again. Otherwise (if he gets a 7, for example) he loses the match.

The most popular versions of craps follow the rules we show above! It is the dice game par excellence! And it is, for many, the most traditional casino game in casinos and online casinos! In the case of online casinos it is even more advantageous due to the high yield in terms of profits. In addition to the low house edge for each of the bets placed.

**Chuck a Luck**: This is a typical North American version of the game. It is played on a table where the 6 faces of the dice are drawn and 3 dice are used. Each player bets on a given number, the dealer rolls the dice and pays the bets for pairs. These come out on three numbers, while the banker collects the others. If a number comes up twice, the win is tripled, and if it comes up three times, the win is quadrupled!

**Pair**: This version is played with 5 dice and a cube (not essential). The object of the game is to score 25 or more points. Whoever gets 24 withdraws his bets and leaves the game. However, the one with less than 24 points pays all the players their bet multiplied by the amount remaining to reach 24. However, if you have 25 or more points you have the possibility to withdraw the payment.

Winnings are calculated based on this list:

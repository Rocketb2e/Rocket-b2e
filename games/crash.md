# ðŸš€ Crash

Beat is an interactive game in which the goal is to withdraw from the game before the graphics crash (stop).

First, you enter the amount you wish to bet on the next round in "Amount". After selecting an amount, press the "Start Game" button. When the next spin begins you will see an increasing multiplier. The graph will continue to climb, and the higher the multiplier, the bigger your payout. However, if you do not withdraw from the game before the graph stops, you will lose your bet. If you successfully withdraw before the graph stops, you will receive the value of your bet times the multiplier. Example: If you bet $10 and cash out when the multiplier is 2.00x, you will receive $20 in your wallet.

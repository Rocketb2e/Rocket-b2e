* It will not be possible to have more than 1 account per investor, and if this is identified, both accounts will be removed.

**I log into my account and all my coins are gone?**

* There are several reasons why this can happen, unfortunately this has nothing to do with our site.
* Reason 1: Make sure that nobody else is using your account.&#x20;
* Reason 2: Viruses / Exploits / Harmful browser extensions. Rocket B2E does not advise any of its users to use any browser extensions of any kind when playing on Rocket B2E.

Listed above are two examples of why your coins may be missing. Please note that we do NOT refund these types of incidents. We refund only what we can see and verify in our logs/DataBase.

The admin/bots/moderators of Rocket B2E will NEVER add you on Steam and will never request any of your items. Be wary of donation scams and impersonation.

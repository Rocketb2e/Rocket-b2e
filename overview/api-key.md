# ðŸŽ± API Key

Rocket B2E has a P2P (player to player) deposit and withdrawal system for CS:GO skins. Our system allows users to deposit and withdraw CS:GO items even when the Steam inventory is loaded. This is made possible through the Steam API key. To use the Steam API key, we need the user to generate and provide us with their API key.

**Why do we ask you to provide an API key?**

The API key is needed to ensure stable and correct P2P operation. This makes our P2P trading system more reliable. Using the Steam API Key, we can confirm that the transaction has been made between two users and track the status of their trade (only trade created on the Rocket Bet2Earn site). Your Steam API Key will be used on Rocket B2E only to check the status of sent and received trade offers that are created on Rocket B2E.

**What should I trust and provide Rocket B2E with my Steam API key?**

Rocket B2E has never put our users in danger and has not demanded information from them that would harm them. The biggest misconception about the Steam API Key is that with this 'key' you can do absolutely anything with your Steam account. Not true! The Steam API Key has a limited set of features. This 'key' does not allow us to reset your password, change your account email address, disable two-factor authentication, send and receive trade offers, view any other confidential information in your account. You can check this and learn more about the actions that can be performed with the Steam API Key on the official Steam API website**:** [**https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi**](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi)****

**How do I generate my Steam API key and provide it with Rocket B2E ?**

Rocket B2E will ask for your Steam API Key when you try to use the P2P system. We will provide a link directly to the page where you can create this "key". A "domain" will be requested on the page. This can be anything, for example "localhost" or "google". Once your key is generated, simply copy and paste it into the field provided on the exchange page. If you successfully verify your Steam API key in our system, you can start trading on the P2P system.

**Secure rules with API key.**

Unfortunately, there is such a thing as an "API scam" in the Steam and CS: GO community. If scammers have gained access to your API key, they can replace your exchange offer on Steam and your items will be sent to the scammers. The API key alone is not enough for scammers. They need your data from a Steam account, they can get it using browser extensions (do not install suspicious and unknown extensions) and phishing sites (these sites are similar to regular sites with Steam authorization, only for authorization they use a fake page, very similar on Steam). Before authorizing via Steam on an unknown resource, check the address specified in the browser (it belongs to Steam). If you went to the API key generation page and found that the key was generated previously, but you don't remember how you created it, immediately change your Steam account password and then change the API key to a new one. If during the Rocket B2E exchange our system detects that your Steam exchange offer has been replaced, we will try to cancel this exchange offer as soon as possible and send you a notification that you need to change your Steam account password.
